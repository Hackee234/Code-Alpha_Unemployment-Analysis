This project focuses on analyzing unemployment rate data that represents the percentage of unemployed people over time. Using Python, the analysis involves cleaning and exploring the dataset, visualizing unemployment trends, and studying the impact of COVID-19 on employment levels. The project also identifies key patterns and seasonal variations in unemployment rates and presents meaningful insights that can support economic planning and social policy decisions.
